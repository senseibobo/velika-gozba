This is a game me and my friends made for homework to get chosen to be one of 7 teams participating in Hakaton za Srednjo≈°kolce 4.<br>
It's my first time working in a team for a competition and I think it turned out pretty nice.<br>
The game is an adventure side scroller where you gather food (by killing it)<br>
Features:
- Movement
- Hitting with pan (spacebar) and jumping with a pot to dodge bullets and land with an attack (E or C)
- 4 levels, where the 2nd and 4th one are boss fights
- 3 difficulties
- Game save system
- Parrying mechanic, when you hit a projectile with the pan, it bounces back.
- Highscore leaderboard (which doesn't work anymore because our database expired :p)
- 5 random screen shaders to spice up the experience (Screen flip, rainbow, black and white, wavy, and darkness)
